### Background

Neuroscience Gateway was started to provide researchers with
easy, free access to tools on NSG supercomputers.  A web portal
and a REST interface are provided.
 
### The NSG Portal

 [NSG Portal](http://www.nsgportal.org) is a simple entry point.
There is a [FAQ](http://www.nsgportal.org/faq.html).

### Registration Form

To request an account, fill out and submit the form
at [Registration Form](http://www.nsgportal.org/gest/reg.php).

You will receive email confirmation when the account is approved.

The NSG software infrastructure is based on software developed by the
[CIPRES Science Gateway](http://phylo.org).

NSG, a resource for the neuroscience community, is funded by current and past
grants from the US National Science Foundation, the US National Institute of
Health, and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council
