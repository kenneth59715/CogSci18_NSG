Neuronal simulations, along with data and image analysis, are well-suited
to processing on supercomputer clusters.  The National Science Foundation
provides supercomputer clusters for use by the research community.  Use
of these clusters requires a detailed application justifying the request
for compute time, as well as knowledge of batch system usage.  To allow
easier use of NSG clusters by researchers in the neuroscience community,
the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) project was started.  This project provides
a web portal interface and a RESTful interface to neuroscience tools on
NSG supercomputers.


> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through usage of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG)
> portal.  If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize
> the word “file” and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words
> for the same thing), you're ready for this lesson.
>
> If you're already comfortable manipulating files and directories,
> searching for files with `grep` and `find`, and writing simple loops
> and scripts, you probably want to explore the next lesson: [shell-extras](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/).
