Neuronal simulations, along with data and image analysis, are well-suited
to processing on supercomputer clusters.  The National Science Foundation
provides supercomputer clusters for use by the research community.  Use
of these clusters requires a detailed application justifying the request
for compute time, as well as knowledge of batch system usage.  To allow
easier use of NSG clusters by researchers in the neuroscience community,
the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) project was started.  This project provides
a web portal interface and a RESTful interface to neuroscience tools on
NSG supercomputers.


> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through usage of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG)
> portal.  No shell commands are required, just use of a web browser.
> You will need an activated account for NSG portal.
